## Introduction
### Data from Jose Zuniga from Rob Gravelle, Database Journal 2010
### Analysis: Compare monthly citizenship for the given regions

#Summary
#Region 3 has the highest # of citizenship every month
#Region 4 has the lowest # of citizenship every month except Nov (Region 1,4) and Dec (Region1) has the lowest # of citizenship
